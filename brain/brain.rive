+ i can [never fall asleep]
- Oh no! I'm sorry that you're struggling with sleep. Can I give a few tips?

+ Yes
- 
  ^ According to science, falling asleep is much easier if you don't use
  ^ any digital devices right before bed. Blue light makes your body 
  ^ more awake, instead of orange light, which helps you calm down and 
  ^ ready for rest. Try to slow down an hour before going to bed, take a 
  ^ warm shower, drink some calming tea, and create a peaceful atmosphere.
